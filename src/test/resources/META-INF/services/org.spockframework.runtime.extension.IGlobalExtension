#this is a generic service loading mechanism in java projects
#spock-core has been added as a depenedency in the pom.xml
#check the spock-core dependency under external dependencies in the project explorer window
#it has IGlobalExtension interface under org.spockframework.runtime.extension
#This interface has been implemented in the support.myspock.CustomGloablExtension class
#a file with its name as the full path of IGlobalExtension iterface is created
#in the file, the path to the actual implementation of the interface must be included
#in this case, it is - support.myspock.CustomGlobalExtension
#this file is then placed under META-INF/services folder under resouces directory
#based on this setup, CustomGloablExtension class will be used everywhere
#such a setup is possible only for interfaces or abstract classes, not concrete classes
